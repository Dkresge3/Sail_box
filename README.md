# DIY-sailing-instrument-for-performance-small-boat-racing



In perfomance sailing instruments such a Raymarine's Tack Tick provide very valuable feed back. The Tack Tick provides a digtal compass read out as well as a build in stop watch. For the $400 price tag, it offers very few features. This project is to prototype making a custom sailing insterment that has a digital read-out compass as well as other features such as GPS and Speed.
